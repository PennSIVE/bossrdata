Description: This data package is intended facilitate application of the vignette examples by providing a manageable 4D array. 
    The oligo dataset in bossrdata consists of a small 4D region-of-interest in cortex from an adult transgenic mouse 
    expressing EGFP in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes (MOBP-EGFP). This same region was imaged at least weekly using two-photon 
    imaging through a cranial window over the course of cuprizone-treatment and recovery.
