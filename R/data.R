#' Oligodendrocyte array
#'
#'  The oligo dataset in bossrdata consists of a small 4D region-of-interest in cortex from an adult transgenic mouse
#'  expressing EGFP in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes (MOBP-EGFP). This same region was imaged at least weekly using two-photon 
#'  imaging through a cranial window over the course of cuprizone-treatment and recovery.
